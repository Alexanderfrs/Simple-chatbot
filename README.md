# Simple-chatbot

Codecademy chatbot project that takes in user utterances and generates responses with regular expression matching

This implementation of a closed-domain chatbot simulates a restaurant waiter that provides basic informtion about the menu on offer. The class has several methods that can be called depending on which direction the user's input takes the conversation. There are 3 essential components to the chatbot:

intent classification
entity recognition
response selection

Of course, these implementation can be adapted for a more comprehensive set of alienbot responses.

The code is written in Python 3.8 and requries the collections, responses, user_functions, re, spacy and nltk libraries. To run the program, make sure that all three files ('script.py', 'responses.py' and 'user_functions.py') are in the same working directory of your preferred source-code editor.
